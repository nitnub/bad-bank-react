# Bad Bank Exercise

Bootcamp project to demonstrate the application of learned front end concepts & technologies. For this project, we were given feature requirements and loose wireframes with guidance to build a basic bank interface with the following functionality:
* Create Account
* Deposit
* Withdraw 
* View all customer data

In addition to the above, I also added account statements and a pseudo-login functionality to interact with different user accounts. 


## Technologies
Some of the technologies I integrated into my version of the "Bad Bank" were...

* Built with React
* Utilized React-Bootstrap components 
* Formik forms with Yup validation
* Jest testing via test and spec files
* Deployment via Amazon S3 bucket
